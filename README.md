# ✅ To-Do List App

A simple, clean, and responsive To-Do List App built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
It helps users manage daily tasks efficiently by allowing them to add tasks with **date and time**, mark them as completed, and delete them. All tasks are saved in **local storage**, so your data stays even after refreshing or closing the browser.

Let me know if:
- You added extra features (like edit, dark mode, filter by date, etc.)
- You want a better design style for the screenshot
- You want help deploying this to GitHub Pages or Vercel

I'll update the README accordingly.
